# Jupyter Notebook and Conda in VSCode

This tutorial assumes that you have installed conda and created a conda environment for the workshop. It also assumes that you have downloaded and installed the VSCode application and added extensions for: Python and Jupyter.

1) Open the VSCode application and use the file navigator to open a folder to save your work during the workshop.

2) Create a new file, and make sure it has the .ipynb ending which will indicate to VSCode that it is a Jupyter notebook.

3) Once you save the new name, the file should show a Jupyter cell and a spot in the upper right to `Select Kernel`.
