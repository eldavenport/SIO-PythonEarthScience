That is not a practical way to work if we need to run programs that take a long time.\n",

Before you log out, add and commit the changes. Return to your local computer and `git pull` to see the updated project without being logged into the computer. This is a great way to keep figures up to date. You will generate new figures, commit and push both the figures and the code that generated them, and then pull them to your local computer. This negates the need to use `scp` or `rsync` to continually move around copies of your figures and prevents confusion about which code generated which version of the figures.\n",

        "2) Tracking an existing project: Log onto your server. Navigate into a directory where you have code for your project. Use `git init` to make the project into a repository (make sure to have a .gitignore file!). Push the repo to your GitHub. Proceed with your work on the server. Add and commit (and push) any changes before you log out. Return to your local computer, use the link on GitHub to clone your repository. Now you can see the work you were doing on the server!"
