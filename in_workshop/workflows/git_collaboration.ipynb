    "First we will talk about the _technical_ aspects of collaboration with Git including common workflows, updating your branch when the main branch has changed, resolving conflicts and making pull requests. Then we will move to more _conceptual_ aspects of collaboration with Git such as managing your work in ways that facilitate fewer conflicts, opening issues, and reviewing other people's code. These tools and workflows would apply equally to private or public repos. Finally we will move on to a more general section about Open Source Software."

    "The most important thing about team workflows is to have one! All collaborators should be aware of the expected workflow. You can even use `Rules` in your repositories to enforce the desired workflow (discussed below). \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common and straightforward team flow is the **Centralized Workflow** (also referred to as the _Trunk-Based_ workflow):\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Everyone works in one repository. This repository can be owned by a teammember or by an organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) There will be one primary, stable version of the code that exists on the `main` branch (the `main` branch is sometimes called the _trunk_).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) In order to make changes to the code, collaborators will:\n",
    "    - Create a new branch off of `main`\n",
    "    - Develop and test their changes on the branch\n",
    "    - Open a Pull Request to merge their changes into `main`\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Feature branches exist for the time it takes to complete the task, and eventually are merged back into `main`. This is in contrast to other (less popular) workflows where multiple primary branches exist and features that are not in `main` may be maintained indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) In this workflow you do not develop directly to the `main` branch. This keeps the primary branch stable and usable even while new code is under development and testing. It is often possible to merge your feature branch directly into main, without a Pull Request, but this is generally frowned upon in a collaborative setting. "
