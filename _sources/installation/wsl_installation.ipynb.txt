    "These instructions will walk you through the installation of Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). WSL allows you to run Linux on your Windows computer. This will allow you to create files, run software, and navigate your filesystem as if you were on a Linux computer. Your work will still be available to you through the Windows interface as well. Most modern software tools are designed to be used on Unix systems like Linux or MacOS. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you cannot install WSL because your Windows version is too old, then you should use Git Bash (instructions included)."
