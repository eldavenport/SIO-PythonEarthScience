# Installing Git in a Unix Shell 

You will need a free [GitHub]() account to use Git. Create one there first before continuing the install. 

### Windows and Linux 

Open your Unix shell:
    1) WSL on Windows

    2) Terminal on Linux

Type `sudo apt install git` and Enter.

If you followed the instructions for Git Bash on Windows, then you already have Git installed.

### MacOS

Open the terminal, type `git --version` and Enter. If you get a version string, then you already have Git installed. Otherwise you should see instructions for installation with XCode. You can either exit those instructions and use homebrew (a MacOS terminal tool for installing things), or you can continue with XCode.

1) XCode
    
    a) After you enter `git --version` you should see instructions for installation with XCode. 
    
    b) Follow the installation instructions for the **command line developer tools only**. You do _not_ need to click get XCode. 

2) Homebrew

    a) Open the terminal, type `brew install git` and hit enter.
